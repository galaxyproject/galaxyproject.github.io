			<h2>Open Source Software Projects</h2>
			<p>
				The Galaxy Project has produced numerous open source software offerings to help you build your
				science analysis infrastructure. Our software covers the gamut from helping you integrate new
				software into our platform, to a production-ready engine to run those programmes in complex MapReduce
				workflows.
			</p>

			<h3>Human-Friendly Science</h3>
			<p>
				<img class="pimg" align="left" src="https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Images/GalaxyLogo?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=galaxy_project_logo.jpg" >
				<a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy">Galaxy</a> is our first and primary product, an open
				source (AFL) workflow engine enabling rapid analysis on your compute infrastructure.
				Galaxy itself enables you or your researchers to do reproducible analyses, an absolute
				necessity in the realm of science.
			</p>
			<p>
				Galaxy additionally allows design and execution of complex MapReduce-type workflows, giving power users
				command of complex pipelines, and all of your users the ability to remix analyses to suit their own
				needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				All of the work researchers do on a Galaxy instance is exportable and transferable to other Galaxy
				instances, allowing them security and peace of mind that their data is under their control.

			<h3>Get Galaxy</h3>
			<h4>for Developers and Small Groups</h4>
			<p>
				If you're just one person, a complete Galaxy setup with a cluster backing it might be overkill! For
				smaller users who may just want to play around with Galaxy we offer pre-built 
				<a href="https://images.galaxyproject.org/planemo/">Virtual Machines</a>,
				a base <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bgruening/galaxy-stable/">Docker Image</a>, and a number of
				variant <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Abgruening+docker-galaxy">Docker Galaxy Flavours</a>
				specialised for different types of analysis. If you've elected to do a "bare metal" deployment, the
				<a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook">Ansible roles</a> we've published, 
				and <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity">Gravity</a> (a Galaxy supervisord configuation
				manager) may ease your deployment experience.
			</p>
			<h4>for the Cloud</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="pimg" align="left" src="https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Images/GalaxyLogos?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=cloudman-logo.png" >
				For running Galaxy on the cloud, we built <a href="https://launch.usegalaxy.org/launch">Galaxy Cloud Launch</a>
				on top of <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudman">CloudMan</a>. With a simple form, you can
				spin up as large or small of a Galaxy Instance as you need, on your preferred IaaS compute
				infrastructure. Our publicly-available Cloud Launch only supports AWS EC2. CloudMan helps you manage the
				entire lifecycle of your temporary compute infrastructure, from instantiation, to dynamic scaling, to
				cleanup of resources when you're done with your analysis.
			</p>
			<h4>for Enterprise-grade Galaxies</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="pimg" align="left" src="https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Images/GalaxyLogos?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=pulsar_transparent.png">
				For SysAdmins and HPC/Cluster maintainers, the Galaxy workflow engine interacts with DRMAA
				Compatible Schedulers, and has native support for HTCondor. The Galaxy Project has also built a few
				tools to help ease your installation process. <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar">Pulsar</a> allows you to have
				Galaxy run jobs on remote systems (including Windows), without a shared file system. For your
				configuration and deployment needs, we've written <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/infrastructure-playbook">
				Ansible playbooks</a> and even published the <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/usegalaxy-playbook">
				ones we use to deploy UseGalaxy.org</a>. There are <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/ansible-galaxy-tools">
				further sets of roles</a> to help you manage all of the tools your users will ask you for.
			</p>

			<h3>Galaxy Tools: Use and Development</h3>
			<h4>The Toolshed</h4>
			<p>
				The <a href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu">Galaxy Toolshed</a>
				offers a place to publish your tools (scientific software wrappers) and discover new ones.
				The Toolshed allows Galaxy administrators to evaluate and
				install Galaxy tools for their local instance.
			</p>
			<h4>Software Integration and Testing</h4>
			<p>
				<img class="pimg" align="left" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/galaxyproject/planemo/master/docs/planemo_logo.png" >
				<a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo">Planemo</a>
				is our standout tool which allows for designing and building
				software interfaces between the Galaxy analysis system and your
				tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				Planemo can do it all! It covers the entire tool lifecycle, from
				helping you <a href="http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writing.html">write new Galaxy tools</a>,
				to easing the pain points of <a href="http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writing_advanced.html?highlight=testing#test-driven-development">tool testing</a>, to
				getting your tools <a href="http://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/publishing.html">published in our toolshed and available</a>
				to people around the world!
			</p>

			<h3>Galaxy Tools: Reproducibility</h3>
			<p>
				For the Galaxy Project, nothing is more important than reproducibility. A large part of this is helping
				ensure that if a specific tool can be installed once, that anyone, anywhere will be able to reproduce
				that analysis on their own instances of our platform.
			</p>
			<h4>StarForge</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge/">StarForge</a> exists to build Galaxy dependencies,
				wheels, and other things, in Docker. With it, you can reproducibly build Galaxy Toolshed Dependencies,
				and the Galaxy Team can build our python wheels which we use to ship Galaxy's requirements.
			</p>
			<h4>bioaRchive</h4>
			<p>
				The bioaRchive is a project by the Galaxy Team to store all
				versions of bioaRchive packages, helping with reproducibility
				of Bioconductor R package installation.
			</p>
			<h4>The Community Package Cache</h4>
			<p>
				The CPC is a new experiment to help long-term reproducibility and maintenance of Galaxy tools.
				It provides a long-term permanent storage of genomic tool
				binaries. Say you need a particular version of a perl package,
				but are concerned that the author might one day remove it, the CPC is the
				<a href="https://github.com/erasche/community-package-cache">resource you want</a>!
			</p>

			<h3>Build on top of Galaxy</h3>
			<p>
				Perhaps you have additional functionality you wish to build on
				top of Galaxy that may not be appropriate for direct inclusion.
				Take advantage of <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend">BioBlend</a>,
				our python library to talk to Galaxy's API.
